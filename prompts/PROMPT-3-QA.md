# PROMPT 3: Implementation Q&A

Now let's flesh out this document toward implementation. Take on the role of an interviewer/consultant.

The goal: by the end, we'll have everything needed to produce a spec that gives a developer (or AI coding agent) clear execution details — without over-specifying to the point where it discourages intelligent judgment on implementation.

This includes resolving:
- Any remaining vision questions or ambiguities
- Questions that help us get closer to technical decisions: tech stack, key libraries, architectural approach
- Implementation shape: what to build first, how to phase it

First, briefly list out the questions you have — whatever is needed to accomplish the goal. Pay attention to ambiguities, gaps, priority questions, edge cases, etc.

Then, work through each question with us ONE BY ONE, turn by turn in our conversation. For each:
1. Give us context on why this question matters
2. Offer potential options with descriptions as specific as needed
3. Recommend the option most aligned with our stated development principles and our vision, with a clear explanation
4. Invite us to discuss, add nuance, or suggest our own approach before continuing

After each question is resolved, add the Q&A to a running document. Once we've worked through all the questions, we'll use this Q&A in a follow-up step to produce the final implementation-ready spec.
