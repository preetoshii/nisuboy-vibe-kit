# PROMPT 3: Implementation Q&A

Now let's flesh out this document toward implementation. Take on the role of an interviewer/consultant.

The goal: by the end, we'll have what's needed to produce a **Launchpad Spec** — a spec that plans to **first life**: the point where the thing is alive, working end-to-end, tangible, usable. Not polished, not complete, but *breathing*. We're not planning the whole journey — just enough to bring it to life. Everything after that emerges from building.

This includes resolving:
- Any remaining vision questions or ambiguities
- Technical decisions for the foundation: tech stack, key libraries, architectural approach
- What milestones get us to first life — a working, usable thing

First, briefly list out the questions you have — whatever is needed to reach first life. Pay attention to ambiguities, gaps, priority questions, and what's essential for the foundation.

Then, work through each question with us ONE BY ONE, turn by turn in our conversation. For each:
1. Give us context on why this question matters
2. Offer potential options with descriptions as specific as needed
3. Recommend the option most aligned with our stated development principles and our vision, with a clear explanation
4. Invite us to discuss, add nuance, or suggest our own approach before continuing

After each question is resolved, add the Q&A to a running document. Once we've worked through all the questions, we'll use this Q&A in a follow-up step to produce the Launchpad Spec.
