# PROMPT 2: Revision (optional, repeatable)

We reviewed the spec and have some notes, questions, and thoughts - some rough, some concrete. First, let's go through each point one by one (some may require extensive discussion to come to a conclusion together through conversation, but some might be as simple as agreeing or moving forward). Once our entire conversation for a single note / point is done, please update the document accordingly — revising, adding, removing, emphasizing, or restructuring as needed while maintaining the overall clarity and tone. Let's go through each point one by one.

1. [note]
2. [note]
