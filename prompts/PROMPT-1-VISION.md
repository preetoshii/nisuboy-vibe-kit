# PROMPT 1: Initial Vision Spec

Here's a transcript of a voice message where my brother and I explained our idea. It's rough, roundabout, and messy — we prioritized capturing every nuance even if that meant redundancies or circling back. It mostly conveys the WHAT (the vision/outcome) with some higher-level ideas about HOW, maybe with some implementation specifics, but not necessarily gospel that you need to adhere to (since we are not advanced developers, and we were just spitballing possibilities that should clue you in to our intention):

Your task: First, DEEPLY understand and analyze the idea. Then create an INITIAL spec document (markdown) that, at this stage, expresses the VISION clearly, eloquently, and non-redundantly — organized and concise while preserving the nuances of our intent. In the case where our transcript details not just the vision of the desired experience, but maybe even vision of certain general approaches for implementation we skimmed upon, or even specific implementation ideas we floated ("maybe Supabase," "maybe it can export to markdown or something"), these should also naturally be weaved as signals of our intent and direction, just held loosely as ideas rather than decisions, since the next step is where we'll truly flesh out implementation. Use your judgment on our confidence level to subtly and holistically inform the document.

This document should also include a DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES section close to the top, that uses our development principles mentioned in PRINCIPLES.md. Then, based on what you pick up from our transcript, adjust with project-specific principles or orientations that emerged from what we emphasized or kept returning to — things like our motivations, fears, or preferences that should guide the modification, addition of, or subtraction of elements of these base principles for this particular project.

So, as mentioned, this first pass is for capturing the vision — the what, the why, and the principles guiding it. Once we've reviewed and refined this together, a later step is where we'll tackle open questions, tech stack, and more detailed implementation. For now, we are focusing on vision.
